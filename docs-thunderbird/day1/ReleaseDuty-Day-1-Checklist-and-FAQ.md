If you're reading this page it means that you're ramping up as an official releaseduty squirrel within Mozilla RelEng, so please allow us to give you a warm welcome!

Releaseduty is a designated pass-the-token role that we assign every 6 weeks to members of the team. The role mainly involves handling all the coordination and communication with other [teams](#teams) as well as doing all the operational tasks to make sure the release workflow is as smooth as possible.

While this role can get quite disruptive, we prefer this approach of assigning the responsibility to a small set of people who will own all the tasks, while we shield the others in Release Engineering from interruptions.

Being ReleaseDuty means a couple of things:
- Communication and coordination with other teams
- Handle all incoming releases
- Fix and debug any potential errors in the automation
- Develop and improve the Release Automation process and tools

## Communication

Most of the steps and milestones of a release will be sent by email. The rest of the communication takes place in a few IRC channels.

The automation status is sent by email, and very spammy.

Meetings are usually conducted using [Vidyo](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SD/Vidyo)

### IRC Channels

Join Mozilla's IRC network using either the [public documentation](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) or if you have an LDAP account, you can also use [IRCCloud](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SD/IRCCloud+Account+Setup)

You ought to be present and pay attention to conversations happening in:

- **_#ci** (where CIduty team helps with various hiccups that infra might enocunter))
- **_#releaseduty_** (main RelEng dedicated communication channel for releaseduty)
- **_#release-drivers_** (where QE and RelMan usually coordinate)
- **_#relman_** (optional - about to be retired soon, where RelMan hangs out around usually)
- **_#tbdrivers_** (optional - where TB drivers discuss Thunderbird releases)

### Email

As ReleaseDuty you need to *subscribe* to certain mailing lists.

- All types of sign-offs and approvals should go to [release signoff mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/release-signoff)
- All releng automation emails should go to [release-automation-notifications](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/release-automation-notifications)
- All discussion topics should go to [release drivers mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/release-drivers)

These other mailing lists will likely have useful discussions and information:
- [RelEng internal mailing list](release@mozilla.com)
- [Thunderbird release drivers mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/thunderbird-drivers)
- [release-automation-notifications-thunderbird mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/release-automation-notifications-thunderbird)
- (optional) [release-automation-notifications-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.com/forum/#!forum/release-automation-notifications-dev)

### Meetings and Calendars

Regular meetings are a vital part of making sure all the teams are kept informed and consulted during the release process. To view those meetings in your calendar you need to subscribe/be added to the following calendars:
- [Public - Release Engineering](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d32343333353036312d393737%40resource.calendar.google.com) (so that you attend the weekly post-mortem meeting)
- [Releases Scheduling](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_dbq84anr9i8tcnmhabatstv5co@group.calendar.google.com) (so that you can attend the Tuesday/Thursday channel meetings. You can add it following RelMan's [docs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management#Calendar_Updating))
-- If their instructions don't work, try to the "Add to Google Calendar" button at the [web version of the calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_dbq84anr9i8tcnmhabatstv5co@group.calendar.google.com).

_**If you join a calendar and it's blank, you may need to delete it and get a calendar invitation from an existing subscriber**_

### Documents

There's a simplified documentation for mid-betas and release checklists to ease the steps needed to happen. If not already, duplicate an existing sheet in this [google docs checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhYtmyLc0GEk_NaK45KjRvhyppw7s7YSpC9xudaQZgo/edit#gid=1158959417) and clear out the status that was carried over from the previous release.

## Repository and Tool Access

Several tools for managing releases are protected or private.
In order to do your job,  you need to be granted access to a bare minimum:

- Access to the [VPN](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SD/VPN)
- A [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) account
- Write access to [releasewarrior-2.0](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-2.0/) and [releasewarrior-data](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-data/) repo
- Read/write access to [Balrog](https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/)
- Read access to [Ship-it](https://ship-it.mozilla.org/)
- SSH access to `buildbot-master01.bb.releng.use1.mozilla.com`.

There are a few more other places where access is needed (such as [bouncer](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/), etc) but we're trying to keep those access-list short so addings can be done in time depending on necessities.

## Installing Tools

### ReleaseWarrior

This is the wiki for ReleaseWarrior! It helps us keep track of the releases in flight and generating the post-mortem.

See [the releasewarrior repo](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-2.0/#installing) for instructions on installation and configuration

The `release` command should now be available inside your virtual environment. Other wiki pages will explain how to use it.

### taskcluster

Release tasks are usually run through [Taskcluster](https://docs.taskcluster.net/), which has a useful [Command-line interface](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-cli)

- Download an appropriate binary from <https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-cli#installation>
- Copy the binary somewhere useful, such as somewhere in your [`$PATH`](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html)
- Make it executable, if using Mac or Linux: `chmod a+x /path/to/taskcluster`
- `taskcluster signin` - this will open a browser window and allow you to get temporary client credentials. By default this is valid for 24 hours. **The command will display two `export` commands you must copy/paste into your shell**
- Familiarise yourself with the subcommands, starting with `taskcluster help`

### Firefox bookmarks

These bookmarklets should help you view tasks and taskgroups in Firefox.

* Go to Bookmarks -> Show All Bookmarks
* Gear symbol -> New Bookmark
* Name: `task inspector` Location: [https://tools.taskcluster.net/tasks/%s](https://tools.taskcluster.net/tasks/%s) ; Keyword: `task`
* Name: `taskgroup inspector` Location: [https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/%s](https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/%s) ; Keyword: `taskgroup`
* Name: `stop` Location: `javascript:stop();`
  * This can be used to stop further loading in the Task Group Inspector. It shouldn't be used when actively monitoring (ie: watching for failures), but it can greatly speed things up if you're using it for other reasons. Be sure to wait for the initial tasks to load before you use it.

Now if you go to your URL bar, you can type `task TASKID` or `taskgroup TASKGROUPID` and you'll go to that task or taskgroup in the inspector.

## After ReleaseDuty

After your tour of releaseduty, it's customary to spend 1-2 weeks fixing release automation issues. Check the  [Release Automation Improvements trello board](https://trello.com/b/BqnBcfXX/release-automation-improvements) trello board for ideas of what to work on and to add new items as you discover them.

Ensure the next duty cycle have signed up to any phabricator reviews, such as the periodic file updates reviews.

## FAQ

1. *How does the Ship-it workflow function in terms of shipping a new release?*

RelMan submits a new release from [here](https://ship-it.mozilla.org/), another RelMan reviews that and once it hits 'Ready' + 'Do eeaat' the release enters the 'Reviewed' section and waits to be run.
Since there's a `release-runner.sh` script running in a loop on [bm81](https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/default/manifests/moco-nodes.pp#l598), there's a max window of 60 seconds till the job gets its share, following which it enters the 'Running/Complete' table where we can observe its state.
The "Reviewed" tab goes to "No pending release" yet again.

2. *What does release-promotion refer to?*

'Release promotion' is simply the idea that we take an already existing CI build from (e.g. beta) and promote that to being the build we release/ship to users. Prior to this approach, we had always rebuilt Firefox at the start of each new release.
Long story short, release promotion entails taking an existing set of builds that have already been triggered and passed QA and “promoting” them to be used as a release candidate. More on promotion can be found on our wiki [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Release_build_promotion)

3. *What is the train model?*

Since 2012 Mozilla moved to a fixed-schedule release model, otherwise known as the Train Model, in which we released Firefox every six weeks to get features and updates to users faster and move at the speed of the Web. Hence, every six weeks the following merges take place:
[mozilla-beta](http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/) => [mozilla-release](http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/)
[mozilla-central](http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/) => [mozilla-beta](http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/)

We used to have an intermediate branch named 'aurora' in between central and beta but that was brought to end-of-life during April-May 2017. Instead, early beta releases are branded as 'DevEdition'.

4. *What is a partner repack change for FF?*

Partner repacks refer to 3rd party customized branded versions of Firefox that Mozilla is taking care of for some of its clients. With some exceptions, most of the partner reconfigs lie under private repositories.
Mostly, the partner repacks don't need too much of RelEng interference as all bits are held under private git repos and are directly handled by the partnering companies

5. *Is there calendar-based release scheduled for Thunderbird as for Firefox?*

No. It's irregular. Conversations happen on #tbdrivers and TB mailing list and they trigger their release in Ship-it.

6. *Why don't I see update_verify_beta for dot releases?*

From time to time, a handful of issues precipitate a dot release. When that happens, its behavior slightly varies from a normal release. A normal release (e.g. 43.0, 44.0, etc) has its RC shipped to beta channel first before making it to the release channel - for testing purposes, update verify steps are taking place both ways, hence update_verify_release and update_verify_beta steps. Upon a successful testing phase we ship the RC on the beta channel and then on the release channel,
following which we merge the code for the next release cycle so that the beta release bumps its version. In the lights of this logic, a dot release (e.g. 43.0.1 or 44.0.1) happens a certain amount of time after the official release.
For that reason, a dot release can't be tested in beta channel as the at-that-moment beta version is greater than the dot release version, hence the updater would refuse to downgrade. Therefore, there is only one cycle of update_verify for dot releases (update_verify_release == update_verify in this case).

7.  *Is there explicit signoff from RelMan for DevEdition builds?*

No, after b1, there isn't signoff from RelMan on DevEdition builds.  QA only verifies the DevEdition builds every two weeks. With the exception of b1, and assuming all the tasks complete as expected, the DevEdition builds should be shipped at the same time as we receive signoff for the corresponding desktop builds.


8. *How should I inform the ReleaseDuty team of recent changes in automation that may impact an upcoming release?*

You can mention it to the current ReleaseDuty folks in the #releaseduty channel. Please also add it to the upcoming release in the ../releases/FUTURE/ dir. See [future release support](../releases/FUTURE/README.md) for more details.

9. *How do I coordinate with marketing on release day?*

Join the #release-coordination channel on Mozilla Slack
