This document describes automation for ESR52 and older branches.

# Pre-requirements

## understanding release promotion
* this task is optional and refers to understanding how release promotion works
* the original release workflow diagram before Buildbot -> Taskcluster migration, as to November 2015, can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/b733c8be-e607-445f-824a-f3353c287294)
* the up-to-date version of it, as to September 2016, is itteratively divided in two. First graph depicts the logic pieces and all tasks in Taskcluster, but lacks the dependencies between the tasks within the graph, and can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/1b59f91d-1dfa-4d1e-8a50-d2d2759a3fff)
* the follow-up version of it, with all the tasks and graph dependencies can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/29588c49-c18c-4800-be84-cca359d89ffc)
  * A "higher level" diagram of the release process is also available in the [Releng docs](http://moz-releng-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release_workflows/index.html).

## Requirements

* taskcluster-cli installed
* releasewarrior-2.0 installed
* ssh access to `buildbot-master85.bb.releng.scl3.mozilla.com`

## taskcluster setup

To get credentials with 24h lifetime:
`$ eval $(taskcluster signin --scope 'queue:*')`

This sets environment variables so run taskcluster in the same terminal.

# Actions for Desktop related releases

## 1. push to releases dir (mirrors)

### why
* some releases don't automatically push releases to the releases dir automatically. They instead wait on a human decision (sign off) to dictate when candidates dir looks good and we are ready to copy/push to releases dir

### when
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * wait for sign off from release-signoff with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to {cdntest,releases,mirrors}` where version is like: `52.0esr` or `52.2.0esr`, and channel is like: `esr-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `release-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: esr-cdntest channel :)`

### how
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * ESR x.y.Z (ie chemspills/regression fixes) releases can use the jobs in the existing graph.
        * get the taskid for the task named `firefox mozilla-esr52 push to releases human decision task`
        * This task is blocking `[beetmover] firefox mozilla-esr52 push to releases`
        * To resolve the human decision task run the following: `taskcluster task complete $TASK_ID`
    * ESR x.y.0 releases (ie scheduled) use two taskcluster graphs, because the push+shipping tasks will usually timeout in the original graph between building and release day. Pushing to releases happens in a graph 2 and will start once graph 2 is submitted.
        * to generate and submit graph 2 of the release:
            * step 1) get a taskid from a any task in graph 1. this is used by graph 2 for obtaining release version, branch, etc.
            * step 2) call releasetasks_graph_gen.py and pass, among other things, the taskid obtained in step 1:
```bash
$ ssh `whoami`@buildbot-master85.bb.releng.scl3.mozilla.com  # host we release-runner and you generate/submit new release promotion graphs
$ sudo su - cltbld
$ TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1={insert a taskid from any task in graph 1}
$ cd /home/cltbld/releasetasks/
$ git pull origin master  # make sure we are up to date. note: make sure this is on master and clean first
$ cd /builds/releaserunner/tools/buildfarm/release/
$ hg pull -u # make sure we are up to date. note: make sure this is on default and clean first
$ source /builds/releaserunner/bin/activate
# call releasetasks_graph_gen.py with --dry-run and sanity check the graph output that would be submitted
$ python releasetasks_graph_gen.py --release-runner-config=../../../release-runner.yml --branch-and-product-config=/home/cltbld/releasetasks/releasetasks/release_configs/prod_mozilla-esr52_firefox_rc_graph_2.yml --common-task-id=$TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1 --dry-run
# call releasetasks_graph_gen.py for reals which will submit the graph to Taskcluster
$ python releasetasks_graph_gen.py --release-runner-config=../../../release-runner.yml --branch-and-product-config=/home/cltbld/releasetasks/releasetasks/release_configs/prod_mozilla-esr52_firefox_rc_graph_2.yml --common-task-id=$TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1
```

## 2. signoffs

### why
* to guard against bad actors and compromised credentials we require that any changes to primary release channels (esr) in balrog are signed off on by at least two people.

### when

* after the scheduled change has been created by the "updates" task, and prior to the desired publish time

### how

* through the Balrog Scheduled Changes UI (https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules/scheduled_changes)

* RelEng
    * RelEng is responsible for reviewing the scheduled change to ensure that the mechanics are correct. Most notably, the mapping, fallbackMapping, and backgroundRate need to be verified.

* RelMan
    * RelMan is responsible for reviewing the scheduled change to ensure that the shipping time is correct and to authorize that the release may be shipped. If circumstances change (eg, we discover a bug we're not willing to ship) after they sign off, they must revoke their signoff in Balrog.

### example

After the Scheduled Change has been created, the Balrog UI will look something like:
![scheduled change without signoffs](/docs/balrog/media/only_scheduled.png?raw=true)

When RelEng reviews it they will look at the Mapping, Fallback Mapping, and Backgound Rate (circled above). If everything looks good to them, they will click on the "Signoff as..." button and be presented with a dialog like:
![signoff modal dialog](/docs/balrog/media/signoff_dialog.png?raw=true)

After they make their Signoff, the primary UI will reflect that:
![scheduled change with one signoff](/docs/balrog/media/one_signoff.png?raw=true)

RelMan and QE will go through a similar process. Once they make their Signoffs the primary UI will reflect that as well:
![scheduled change with two signoffs](/docs/balrog/media/all_signoffs.png?raw=true)

Now that the Signoff requirements have been met, the Scheduled Change will be enacted at the prescribed time.


## 3. publish release

### why
* the publish release human decision task triggers the balrog change submission, update bouncer aliases, mark as shipped,
  and bump version tasks
* updates are published by Balrog when the scheduled change hits its scheduled time and all required signoffs have been
  completed.
    * It is expected that RelEng and RelMan will sign off on the scheduled changes ahead
      of the ship date for .0 releases, otherwise ASAP after the change is submitted
    * If the ship time, throttle rate, or anything else about the release changes between
      the change being scheduled and the expected ship time, the scheduled change should
      be updated (or deleted) to reflect the change. After doing so, Signoff will be
      required again.


### when
* All Desktop Firefox releases
    * Wait for email on the balrog-db-changes list that shows the mapping on the live channel
      being changed to the Release being shipped.

### how
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * depending on timing you may have 1 or 2 graphs. Go to the latest one and
      find taskId of `publish release human decision task`
    * Resolve the "publish release human decision" task using the command below
```bash
 taskcluster task complete $TASK_ID
```

## 4. post release step

### why
* releases are needed to be marked as "shipped" in Ship-it to make the partial
  guessing algorithm work and make sure the product-details site has correct information
  about releases.

### when
* immediately after running `publish release` human decision step

### how
* Desktop Firefox Betas, Desktop Firefox Release, Desktop Firefox dot Releases, Desktop Firefox ESRs and Fennec Beta/Releases
    * it is done automatically so just sanity check that the `<product> <channel> mark release as shipped` has completed successfully in the graph
* Other *not* release-promotion based releases (Thunderbird) are needed to be marked as shipped on Ship It. To do so, visit
  https://ship-it.mozilla.org/releases.html, find the release in question, and
  click the "Shipped!" button.


# Troubleshooting

## Intermittent failures

If a task failed because of an intermittent failure (e.g.: network error, timeout), `rerun` it manually via [taskcluster cli](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-cli/). Some tasks don't have automatic reruns set, but they do have 5 retries left. Thanks to reruns, you don't need to retrigger a task (which would have meant to reschedule the remaining subgraph).

## Flushing caches

If more than one build ran on a beta we need to flush the caches to remove the older builds from the CDN caches.  For instance in Firefox beta 46.0b5 we built builds 1 through 5 but we only ship build5.  See [Bug 1391843](https://bugzil.la/1391843) - Please purge CDN caches for firefox and devedition 56.0b4 as an example. After filing the bug as P1, it's highly recommended you follow up with the [mana docs](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SVCOPS/Contacting+Cloud+Operations) to contact CloudOps by email as well as they don't always pay attention to P1 bugs.

## Working around Signoffs in Balrog

The Required Signoffs we have implemented in Balrog are there for a reason. In general, you should not try to workaround them. On occasion, extreme circumstances may warrant doing so, however. The most likely reason for this would be no members of a particular group being around, and needing to make an urgent change (eg: shutting off updates).

Note that even if you are a full fledged administrator, you yourself cannot make more than one Signoff on any given Scheduled Change. This is by design - we do not want a single account to be able make changes to protected Products or Channels. If you are certain you need to workaround the Signoffs, here's how:
* Find another person with some permissions in Balrog, and who is up to speed on the change you intend to make.
* Grant them the Role that you need to complete the Required Signoffs (through https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/permissions).
* Have them make a Signoff with that Role.

As a concrete example, let's say we required 1 relman, 1 releng, and 1 qe signoff for Firefox release channel changes. Late on a Saturday night we discover a massive crash that requires us to shut off updates. Liz gets in contact with Kim to ask that this happen. Kim Schedules the necessary change in Balrog (which implicitly satisfies the releng signoff), and Liz signs off for relman. Because it is the weekend, and there was no planned work, QE is unavailable. Kim gets in contact with Aki, grants him the "qe" role, and Aki makes a Signoff under the "qe" Role, which fulfills the Signoff requirements. Kim then removes Aki's "qe" Role.

## Creating a clone of a task using a different revision

This works with tasks where the task is on the edge of the graph, and has no dependencies.  Example: create https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/Co8iBgS1RnKVNOWMZm0TUg/tasks/Co8iBgS1RnKVNOWMZm0TUg/details by cloning the failed task (Actions -> Edit Task) and replaced all revision entries with the new one
