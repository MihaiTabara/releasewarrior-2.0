# A word on selecting partials in Ship-it

This is purely informative as this is step performed by RelMan. Yet, it's good to have it at hand in case we're asked.
When selecting partials in [Ship-it](http://ship-it.mozilla.org/), you need to make sure those specific releases lie within both
the `candidates` and `releases` directories. This is because [release-runner](hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/tip/buildfarm/release/release-runner3.py) is
running some sanity checks on each of the provided partials. Part of the checks make sure that the certain release has been
fully pushed to `~candidates` directory and then copied-over into the `~releases` directory. Absent this and the [Ship-it](http://ship-it.mozilla.org/) interface
will throw an error.

# A note on rerunning action tasks

Ocassionally action tasks fail for various reasons (e.g. scope issues). Whenever the fix is done and you're ready to
rerun the action task, make sure you cancel the previous run first. Otherwise, you'll end up with duplicates tasks within
the same graph (e.g. `push` phase run twice ends up with two tasks of `push_to_releases`). Most of the tasks are
idempotent, but to minimize any possible negative outcome, *remember to cancel before rerun*.
On the same page, it's worth noting that in some cases, it's just better **not to** rerun an action task, if some of the tasks
that it had created, had already ran. In this case it's easier to just burn a version number and respin another build number release.
