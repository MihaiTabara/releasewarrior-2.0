# Finding graphids

You have three options for finding graphids:

1. look at the releasewarrior [markdown](#markdown). This is probably the easiest option, as long as you've been updating rw with `release graphid`.
1. run [`get_graphids.py`](#get_graphids.py)
1. look at [treeherder](#treeherder)

In the future, we may also [create a separate index](https://trello.com/c/ArjZh2xI/307-more-improvements-to-how-we-find-action-tasks) where we add action tasks per product/version/buildnum, so we can look these up easily.

## markdown

* look at the releasewarrior releases in flight in the [releasewarrior-data](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-data/tree/master/inflight) repo
* the markdown should contain lines like

    ```
    * promote T4MrrupaQsuMjgu5HtfTKQ
    ```

    The graphids are the 2nd item.

Pros:
- everything is in one place.

Cons:
- releaseduty has to keep these up to date.

## get_graphids.py


* Find the `hg revision` of the release in [Ship It](http://ship-it.mozilla.org/), and copy it.
* Run get_graphids.py from releasewarrior-2.0's scripts directory.

```sh
export REV=.. # Revision from above
python ./scripts/get_graphids.py --output export --revision ${REV}
```

Pros:
- all the graphids in one location, without having to save the info in rw manually

Cons:

- no rc support currently
- there will be issues if the release graphs are on separate revisions from the build
- need to copy/paste revision + run script before getting the info

## treeherder

If you go to [treeherder beta](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-beta&filter-searchStr=decision) or [release](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-release&filter-searchStr=decision), you can find the appropriate action graphid by:

* Find the revision of the release
* The relpro actions will be in the `Gecko Decision Task opt` row of this revision.
  * These will be named their relpro flavor name, e.g. `promote_firefox_rc` or `ship_fennec`.
  * If we use a different revision than the build for a relpro graph, the relpro action task will show up on that different revision.
* click on the task. The taskId will be in the lower left corner, e.g. `Task: T4MrrupaQsuMjgu5HtfTKQ`. The taskId is also the graphId.

Pros:
- all the graphids are shown, including RCs and separate-revision graphs

Cons:
- more clicking
- if an action was run multiple times, there may be multiple relpro actions of the same name.
