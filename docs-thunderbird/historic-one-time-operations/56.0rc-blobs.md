## Create release blob for 56.0rc  (draft)


* Release automation creates a human decision task to block the updates after they are generated.
* You'll need to import the release's ggp key into your keyring, for example wget http://releases.mozilla.com/pub/firefox/candidates/56.0-candidates/build1/KEY; and gpg --import KEY
* Use the transform_balrog_blob.py script in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393789 change the complete mar urls to point to bz2 mars. 
    * Arguments are the release name and output file.  Example: python2.7 transform_balrog_blob.py --wnp Firefox-56.0-build1 blob.json
    * References to complete mars are converted to bz2, file sizes and file hashes are updated
    * References for partials to 56.0bN will be removed from fileUrls and locale data
    * What''s new page will be added
* Submit the new release blob to balrog with product Firefox
* Update rules on release-localtest (id 628) and release-cdntest (id 627) to point to the new release
* Resolve the start_update_verify_human_decision task that rail added in releasetasks

* After the 56.0 release, we had problems with WNP pages being served from these locales
