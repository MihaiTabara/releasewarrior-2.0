Currently, two products may need manually signing:

* Firefox Rocket
* Firefox Focus for Android. :warning: This product has two APKs: one is Focus, the other for the german-speaking population: Klar.

## Requirements
Google Play refuses non-optimized APKs. The signature changes the structure of the APK archive, which breaks the Zip optimization.

1. Install the latest Android SDK to get the build tools.
   * MacOSX: `brew cask install android-sdk` (requires `brew tap caskroom/cask`)
     * then run `sdkmanager --list` and install build-tools, e.g. `sdkmanager 'build-tools;27.0.3'`. It'll show up in e.g. `/usr/local/share/android-sdk/build-tools/27.0.3/zipalign`
   * Ubuntu: `apt install android-sdk`
   * Other: [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#Other)

## First Steps
1. `ssh signing4.srv.releng.scl3.mozilla.com`
1. Change to the `cltsign` user:
   ```sh
   sudo su - cltsign
   ```

## To sign an APK
You will need to repeat this for each APK, feel free to optimise by downloading all at once, just be careful of filenames when copy/pasting commands.

1. Download unsigned APK(s).
   * Right-click the attachment in bugzilla and click 'Copy Link Location'
   * `wget -O unsigned.apk <pasted url>`
1. Set environment variables:
   * For Focus/Klar:
     ```sh
     keystore='/builds/signing/rel-key-signing-server/secrets/focus-jar'
     alias='focus'
     ```
   * For Rocket:
     ```sh
     keystore='/builds/signing/rel-key-signing-server/secrets/rocket-jar'
     alias='rocket'
     ```
1. Look up the right keystore password in the releng private repo
   * Focus/Klar is under the name `signing-server-focus`
   * Rocket is under the name `signing-server-rocket`
1. `jarsigner -keystore "$keystore" unsigned.apk "$alias"`
   You'll be asked for the password in the previous step. The Klar APK uses the same certificate alias/password as `focus`.
   You'll also get an expected warning:
   ```
   Warning:
   No -tsa or -tsacert is provided and this jar is not timestamped. Without a timestamp, users may not be able to validate this jar after the signer certificate's expiration date (2044-10-25) or after any future revocation date.
   ```
1. `mv unsigned.apk signed.apk`
1. Verify signatures: `jarsigner -verify -verbose -keystore "$keystore" signed.apk "$alias"`
1. If your product has several APKs, repeat the previous steps. You may want to give the files more useful names, such as `app-rocket-webkit-release-signed.apk`

## After all the signing
1. Fetch signed APK(s) on your local machine. You will need to copy the files to your own user account in order to `scp` them, as you can't directly reach the `cltsign` user.
1. Optimize the APKs for Google Play, and verify. For each APK:
   ```sh
   zipalign -v 4 signed.apk signed-aligned.apk
   zipalign -c -v 4 signed-aligned.apk
   ```
1. Attach the signed and aligned APKs to the bug using the 'attach file' feature in bugzilla.


## Troubleshooting

### Can't sign APKs

Sometimes, APKs aren't correctly formatted. For instance, CI may have already signed an APK with a dev key. In this case, you may see:
```sh
$ jarsigner -verbose -keystore "$keystore" unsigned.apk "$alias"
Enter Passphrase for keystore:
jarsigner: unable to sign jar: java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid entry compressed size (expected 34549 but got 35093 bytes)
```

The fix is just to strip the signature from the package:
```sh
$ zip -d unsigned.apk META-INF/\*
deleting: META-INF/CERT.RSA
deleting: META-INF/CERT.SF
deleting: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

Then you can resume signing.

## Future

We already have a github repo with taskcluster release builds. It's not trivial, but it's possible we could add CoT and auto-sign these release builds.
