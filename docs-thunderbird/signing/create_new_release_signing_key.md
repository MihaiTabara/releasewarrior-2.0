## Create a new release key to sign a new apk product

### The example product here is "rocket"

Before the release day:
1. SSH to a Linux (android) signing server
2. Manually Create a new keystore dedicated to host the new cert[1]. For future automation, passwords for both keystore and certificate must be the same
I usually use `pwgen 80` for the passphrase, scp down to my laptop, scp up to the target server, unzip.
secure wipe (srm, rm -P, etc) the files on laptop afterwards.
I created a keystore called "rocket-jar" in /builds/signing/rel-key-signing-server/secrets. The certificate in there has the alias "rocket".
Just like the release certificate, I filled these values:
```CN=Release Engineering, OU=Release Engineering, O=Mozilla Corporation, L=Mountain View, ST=California, C=US```
I also needed to chmod 600 the keystore file and chown so it has the same owner and group as other signing keystores. 
3. Sign the APK[2]
4. Give the APK back to the Rocket team.

Right after the first APK is signed:
I. Store the passwords on the private repo.
II. Copy the keystore to the other signing servers. Replication is usually done by archiving the keystore in a zip-encrypted archive. The passphrase is usually 80 chars long
III. Create two offline backups of the keys[3].

For next releases:
A. On the signing server, create a new signing format, called something like "rocket-jar"
B. Create new instances of the signing server dedicated to that new format. This can be done by either a new process on the same machine (but a different port) or by creating a new machine.
C. See whether the Focus team is ready to port a part of their automation to Taskcluster. This would ensure the security of the signing process.
